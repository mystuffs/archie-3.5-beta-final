This \`unwrap' script is an elementary tool for upgrading to or installing
your archie $VERS distribution. You need to have gzip installed in your
system. If you do not have it you may get the source through anonymous ftp
from ftp.bunyip.com in the directory /pub/gnu.  The script will proceed in 
two phases:

	Phase 1:  will search for any distribution (*.tgz) files. If any are
		  found, it will try to unpack them in the current archie
		  home directory. Currently there are two distribution
		  files, and you will be prompted before any are unpacked.

		  For an upgrade, care will be taken to move aside any files
		  this script is about to overwrite, by rotating these files
		  (ie:  \`file-a' becomes \`file-a.0', etc. Should any mishap
		  occur, the script \`unrotate' has been provided to assist
		  you in recovering rotated files.
		  
	Phase 2:  will proceed to install an empty archie database. The
		  script will try to determine if you already have such a
		  database. Again, you will be prompted before proceeding.

	It looks like you already have an archie system in ~$ARCHIE. This
	probably means you want to upgrade your system. The 3.3 upgrade only
	requires that you upgrade your binary files along with a few
	miscellaneous files. The \`archie-${VERS}-${ARCH}-${REL}.tgz'
	distribution file contains all you require.
EOC1
			if ( $ARCH != "aix") then
				cat - <<EOC2

	You probably don't need to install this \`base' distribution file.

	If you still want to proceed with the installation of this base
	distribution, then we strongly suggest that you abort this script,
	set the \`archie' home directory in a new location and re-run this
	script.

EOC2

				cat - <<EOC3

	However, on the AIX platform, which you are running on, you will
	need to install this \`base' distribution file along with the
	\`binaries' distribution file. We STRONGLY suggest that you ABORT
	this script, set the \`archie' home directory to a new, empty
	location and re-run this script.
