               Welcome to the Release of archie-3.5
	       ====================================



1. First start by FTPing the distribution:

	archie-3.5-beta-install.tar
	archie-3.5-beta-arch-version.tgz
	archie-3.5-beta-arch-base.tgz		(for a full release install)

   where arch-version is one of: `sunos-4.1.4', `sunos-5.4', or `aix-3.2'.

2. Untar `archie-3.5-beta-install.tar'.

	tar xvpf archie-3.5-beta-install.tar
 
   There you will find three scripts that will be used to install the
   binaries, `unwrap', `untar', and `unrotate'. We are trying out a new
   distribution approach. The single command, `unwrap' should take care of
   installing the server.

3. To install the server software, as superuser, type:

	./unwrap

   And follow the instructions and suggestions. Please let us know what you
   think of this installation script.

4. Finally, don't forget to set the permissions. As superuser type:

	cd ~archie/config
	make
